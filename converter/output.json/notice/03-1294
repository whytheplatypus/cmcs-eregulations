        "1": "In the Medicaid managed care final rule under \u00a7\u2009438.240(c)(2) we permit States to calculate performance measures on the MCO's/PIHP's behalf in place of the MCO/PIHP calculating and reporting performance measures to the State. Under this circumstance, the validation of MCO/PIHP performance measures is not required as a mandatory activity but the State must submit the State-calculated performance measures to the EQRO for the EQR function as specified under \u00a7\u2009438.358(b)(2). This issue is addressed later in the preamble in response to a comment."
