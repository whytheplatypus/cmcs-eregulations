The existing regulation does not expressly rely on the statutory requirement that the Secretaries of HHS and Treasury establish \u201ca process for public notice and comment at the State level, including public hearings . . . \u201d and HHS and the Department of the Treasury are of the view that language, by itself, does not require a particular state to hold more than one hearing.
