The question in <em data-original=\"E-03\">Turner</em> was whether the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution requires States to provide legal counsel to an unrepresented indigent defendant person at a child support civil contempt hearing that could lead to incarceration in circumstances where neither the custodial parent nor the State was represented by legal counsel. The U.S. Supreme Court decision held that under those circumstances, the Fourteenth Amendment does not <em data-original=\"E-03\">automatically</em> require the States to provide counsel if the State has \u201cin place alternative procedures that assure a fundamentally fair determination of the critical incarceration-related question, whether the supporting parent is able to comply with the court order.\u201d The Court found that the Petitioner's incarceration violated due process because he received neither counsel in the proceedings nor the benefit of adequate alternative procedures.",
